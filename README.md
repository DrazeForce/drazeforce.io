Welcome to my [Portfolio](https://drazeforce.vercel.app) Website! This project is built using [**Vite**](https://vitejs.dev) and showcases my skills and projects. Follow the steps below to get it up and running on your local machine.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and [Npm](https://npmjs.com/) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed on your system. You can download Node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/DrazeForce/drazeforce.io.git
   cd drazeforce.io
   ```
2. **Install the dependencies:**

    Using npm:
      ```
   npm install
      ```
   
   Or using yarn:
      ```
   yarn install
      ```
3. **Running the Development Server**

   To start the Vite development server and view the website locally, run:

    Using npm:
      ```
   npm run dev
      ```
   
   Or with yarn:
      ```
   yarn dev
      ```

    This will start the server,and you can view the website in your browser at https://localhost:{host}, The local host server will be displayed in the terminal after you run the command `npm run dev`.

4. ## Building for Production

    To build the website for production, run:

    Using npm:
      ```
   npm run build
      ```
   
   Or with yarn:
      ```
   yarn build
      ```

   This will generate a `dist/` folder containing the production-ready files.

5. ## Deployment

    You can deploy the `dist/` folder to any static hosting services like Vercel, Netlify, etc.

      I hosted mine on [Vercel]([https://vercel.com](https://drazeforce.vercel.app)). To deploy on Vercel, follow these steps:

      * Go to [Vercel](https://vercel.com) and sign in or create an account.
      * Click on "New Project."
      * Import your GitHub repository or drag and drop the `dist/` folder.
      * Follow the prompts to complete the deployment.
